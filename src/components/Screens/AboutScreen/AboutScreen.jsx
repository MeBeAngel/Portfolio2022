        I'm a Jr. Software engineer with the ability to learn and collaborate in
        rapidly changing environments. I Worked through hundreds of hours of
        bootcamp structure, learning JavaScript, React.Js, Node.Js, and MongoDB.
        Whenever I'm not coding, I'm probably playing video games, writing or
        reading a good book.
